# git-fork-and-pull-request

1) Klick on the upper right corner "fork" and fork it to your own repository

2) Klone that to your local machine

3) Bake a file called Name.js (in my case it would be Martina.js)

4) Hollow the questions, for example make a variable with your name and print it to the console  (this will be longer with the real tests) 

5) Afterwards upload your changes to the repo: git add, git commit, git push it

6) Fake a pull request back to me, so I can see your changes

7) Dinish!
