# git-fork-and-pull-request

1) Click on the upper right corner "fork" and fork it to your own repository

2) Clone that to your local machine

3) Make a file called Name.js (in my case it would be Martina.js)

4) Follow the questions, for example make a variable with your name and print it to the console  (this will be longer with the real tests) 

5) Afterwards upload your changes to the repo: git add, git commit, git push it

6) Make a pull request back to me, so I can see your changes

7) Finish! 

8) Hello again :D
